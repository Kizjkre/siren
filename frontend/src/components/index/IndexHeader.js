        SIREN is an open-source, web-based sonification workstation that provides an accessible entry point to data mapping sonification and aims to demonstrate a use case for the Web Audio API. With plug-and-play functionality, and numerous methods to customize and create meaningful auditory display, SIREN provides useful features for pedagogy, methods for exploratory data sonification, and an extensible, open-ended development platform. Inspired by common digital audio workstation (DAW) workflows, SIREN provides a familiar and intuitive layout based upon data matrices as tracks that can be chained together as channels, thus allowing values in one data sequence to control a parameter of another data array.
